Laz, instead of making the manual aa its own option, we should have it be a button. Click keybind
once to override the current yaw to do its thing around one direction, click it again to stop the
override. This would be a much cleaner release, I think. Lets put it in aa column 2, under fakelag.
I am moving it right now, and making edits to spacial use in order to fit everything in the menu.

I am also going to make a giant list of every feature. I will format it like our update log, then
we can release it as a kind of showcase. Having this list will show everyone just how good our
cheat is.
